Need:
    - 25g unsalted butter, cut into two equal sticks.
    - Good quality head of broccoli, those packaged in shops are usually around 300-350g. Can get away with one past its best but you taste the difference. One with a strong stem that isn't too short/cut close is also preferable.
    - Stilton, let's say around 200g for now (precise quantity is proving troublesome). Supermarket is largely fine, keep the good cheesemonger stuff for enjoying on its own. 
    - 1L chicken stock made with a couple stock cubes, doesn't need to be overthought. 
    - A leek. 
    - A white onion, bigger the better.

 Notes:
    - Strength of stilton needs to be taken into account (duh).
    - How far in advance the soup is made prior to serving is MATERIAL - give it a day and it's all going to be a LOT stronger. Consider using a bit less stilton if doing it the day before. 
    - Thinking about using a potato (or something similar) that would beef it up and balance out using more liquid to get more servings out of it. 

Chop the onion, doesn't need to be too cute, fire into the pot with one of the sticks of butter to soften. Leek gets chopped in the meantime, fire it in with the other half of the butter once the onions are softened and smelling as they should. Lid goes on, let it all sweat for 5 or so minutes. Prep the litre of stock. 

Broccoli stem gets cut away from the head, chop it into sensible cubes that aren't going to a hassle a stick blender. Fire it into the pot with the stock, lid back on. It's going to need a good 10-15 minutes to soften, cut the head into florets. 

Florets get chucked in next, give it a good stir. They won't need as long - 10 minutes at a push. Take the opportunity to set aside your stilon, crumb it as best you can (fork is great for this). Set 1/8th aside, probably even less, if you're entertaining. 

Stick the pot on a ring that isn't on and give it all a good stick blend. Your arms are going to get scalded by little bits of molten broccoli mush - enjoy the ride. 7/8ths of the stilton goes in, soup back on the heat, stir gently and let it melt in. Add a good bit of pepper and a touch of salt. Give it all another stick blend. 

Serve it with some warm bread and enjoy. If entertaining, the stilton set aside gets sprinkled on top.
